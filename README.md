</div>

# Purpose
To demonstrate the workflow of a functional product. The project utilizes a development engine, integrates a scripting language similar to C#, and compiles/exports to desktop, mobile, and web-based architectures. The project here is a base for a classic platformer, thought the engine can be used to produce 3D applications, as well as traditional software.
